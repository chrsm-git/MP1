            <h4>How do I do an online consultation?</h4>

            <h4>What are the benefits of online consultation with a doctor</h4>
            <p>You can get professional help earlier about your concern for early treatment and of course, for peace of mind. For follow ups, especially for non-critical cases, it would save you a lot of time and expenses as opposed to going to the clinic, waiting indefinitely and spending time in traffic and money on other necessities during the trip to the clinic.</p>
